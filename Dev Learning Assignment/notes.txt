Dev Learning Assignment

The development part of DevOps is concerned with....
1. understanding how software is built using intentional planning, coding languages, collaboration and various methodologies
2. the automation of processes that reduce the time that it takes to develop new features that a customer can use with minimal errors.

DevOps engineers must be able to understand the code that developers have written and be able to write their own code to automate the set-up and maintenance of reliable infrastructure.

How Code gets Executed

Python code gets executed line by line from the top.
Python interpreter. A program that knows how to translate/interpret python code into instructions our computer can ujnderstand

print("*" * 10)

anywhere we have '' we are defining a string. * 10 means we are multiplying the string by 10
"*" * 10 is also an expression. Expression is a piece of code that produces a value. first will evaluate code between (). The expression will produce 10 * and will be printed on the terminal.
